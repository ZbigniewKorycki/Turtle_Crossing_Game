<h1>Turtle Crossing Game</h1>

This Python script uses the Turtle graphics library to create an interactive game called "Turtle Crossing." In this game, the player controls a turtle character that needs to safely cross a busy road while avoiding oncoming traffic. The game includes features for controlling the player character, tracking the player's score, and providing game-over conditions. 

The project was done as part of the course "100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp for 2023" (https://www.udemy.com/course/100-days-of-code/) - Day 23.
